                    Made a program in R to render an animated bar chart that demonstrated how much

                    Used data from CollegeBoard on average expenses/debt, time to earn degree,
                    and salary after graduation to estimate average return over many years

                    This robot served on a team of 3 robots with the goal of scoring the correct amount points.
                    The amount of points needed was discerned by a set of sensor cubes that either had a certain
                    depth or light level inside of them.

                <li>
                    This robot was responsible for getting the sensor readings needed to discern point values.
                    It uses a LEGO EV3 brick, an ultrasonic sensor, and a light sensor.
